It's a university project. The goal is to make a board game in python without recursion, without try/catch, without imported module and all that in a single file.

The rules :

- There are 2 players who compete on a 7x7 board.
- You can only move your pawns up, down, right and left.
- Type of move:
     - Classic displacement : you can only move one space away
     - Jump with hold : you can jump over an opponent's pawn and capture it a maximum distance of 2 and you must be adjacent to the pawn you want to eat.
- The player who loses the game is the one who has strictly less than 6 pawns on the board or the one who can no longer move

Enjoy !
